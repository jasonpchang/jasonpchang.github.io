   I am a currently a PhD Candidate in Geophysics at Stanford University. I am
   a member of the Stanford Exploration Project, which is advised by Dr. Biondo
   Biondi.

   My research aims to image the subsurface using naturally-occuring seismic
   noise (for example, traffic noise and breaking waves).
