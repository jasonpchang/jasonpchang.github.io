   <p>
   I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geophysics at Stanford University. I am
   a member of the Stanford Exploration Project, which is overseen by Dr. Biondo
   Biondi.
   <br />
   <br />
   My research aims to transform massive amounts of recorded ambient seismic 
   noise (naturally-occurring and/or man-made vibrations) into images of Earth's
   subsurface properties. Such an approach provides a low-cost and effective 
   solution to problems in fields ranging from earthquake engineering to
   astrophysics.
   <br />
   <br />
   I am also an avid sports fan, with a particular interest in sports analytics.
