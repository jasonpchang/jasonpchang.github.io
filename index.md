<!--Hi there! I'm Jason, and I'm currently a PhD candidate in Geophysics at Stanford
University. I'm interested in extracting useful information from large data sets
in geophysics and beyond. Specifically, my research turns massive amounts of 
ambient seismic noise recordings to characterize shallow subsurface properties.
You can find more information about my research under the Research tab. -->

Hi there! I'm Jason, and I'm currently a Software Engineer focused on Data Analysis, Data Mining, and Machine Learning at Linkedin. As part of the Anti-Abuse Artificial Intelligence team, I work on the identification, prevention, and removal of bad actors on Linkedin's multiple platforms.

Prior to joining Linkedin, I earned my PhD in Geophysics from Stanford University. My research demonstrated how massive amounts of continuous recordings of natural ground vibrations could be used to generate geologic maps of the Earth. You can find more information about my research under the Research tab.

Additionally, I am an avid sports fan with a particular interest in sports analytics. You can find some of my work with PitchFX data in baseball under the projects tab.
