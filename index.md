Hi there! I'm Jason, and I'm currently a PhD candidate in Geophysics at Stanford
University. I'm interested in extracting useful information from large data sets
in geophysics and beyond. Specifically, my research turns massive amounts of 
ambient seismic noise recordings to characterize shallow subsurface properties.
You can find more information about my research under the Research tab.

<!--In addition to geophysics, I am an avid sports fan with a particular interest in
sports analytics. You can find my work with PitchFX data in baseball under the
projects tab.-->
Thanks for visiting!
